index.html workflow (basketball court)

1) Bootstrapping
- Imports Three.js, GLTFLoader, OrbitControls.
- Creates scene, camera, renderer, lights, and OrbitControls.
- Adds a simple HUD for status and model loading via file input/drag-drop.

2) Court loading
- GLTFLoader loads `basketball_court.glb` (or the file you choose).
- frameModel(): centers the court, scales it to a target size, and fits the camera.
- positionHoopMarker(): tries to find rim/backboard meshes by name hints. The marker is currently hidden.

3) Player loading
- loadPlayerModel() loads `3d_person.glb` after the court finishes.
- placePlayer(): scales the player based on court size and uses a raycast to place the feet on the court surface.

4) Joint dots (markers)
- collectBones(): gathers skeleton bones if the player is rigged.
- pickBone(): chooses a bone by keywords and side; falls back to position if names are unclear.
- setupJointMarkers(): attaches dots to bones when possible; otherwise uses a bounding-box fallback.
- setMarkerWorldRadius(): keeps dots roughly the same size in world space even if the player is scaled.

5) Controls
- OrbitControls lets you orbit and zoom the camera.
- The hoop marker can still be nudged by keyboard (marker hidden, but logic kept for later use).

Common tuning points
- playerUrl: switch to a different player model.
- playerHeightRatio / playerOffsetRatio / playerFootOffsetRatio: size and placement of the player.
- jointMarkerMaterials / jointMarkerDefs: colors and joints for dots.
